==============

This repository contains the assignment for the BC Public Service code challenge. The project is built using `React.js` for the frontend and `Express.js` for the backend.

Installation
------------
* Clone the repository to your local machine by running `git clone https://github.com/mianp1995/mian-peng-IS24-full-stack-competition-req97073.git`.
* Open a terminal and navigate to the `./client` directory.
* Run `npm install` to install the client-side dependencies.
* Run `npm start` to start the client-side development server.
* Open another terminal and navigate to the `./server` directory.
* Run `npm install` to install the server-side dependencies.
* Run `node server.js` to start the server.

Usage
------------
Once the client-side development server and the server are running, you can open the web application in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000. The application allows you to add and edit products and search products by a scrum master's name or a developer's name.

Once the server-side development server and the server are running, you can navigate to http://localhost:8080/api-docs to check Swagger Documentation.

The `generateProducts.js` in `./server/data` is a random generator script for generating the mock data for this project. The `productsData.json` has been generated in advance, thus `generateProducts.js` is not needed to be run again.
