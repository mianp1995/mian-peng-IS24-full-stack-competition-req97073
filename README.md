BCGovCodeChallenge
This repository contains the code for the BCGovCodeChallenge. The project is built using React.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend.

Installation
1.Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.Open a terminal and navigate to the ./client directory.
3.Run 'npm install' to install the client-side dependencies.
4.Run 'npm start' to start the client-side development server.
5.Open another terminal and navigate to the ./server directory.
6.Run 'npm install' to install the server-side dependencies.
7.Run 'node server.js' to start the server.

Usage
Once the client-side development server and the server are running, you can open the web application in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000. The application allows you to add and edit products and search products by a scrum master's name or a developer's name.

Once the server-side development server and the server are running, you can navigate t0 http://localhost8080/api-docs to check Swagger Documentation.

The 'generateProducts.js file' in ./server/data is a random generator script for generating the mock data for this project. The 'productsData.json' has been generated in advance, thus 'generateProducts.js file' is not needed to be run again.
